A 'ping' like program for the Ethernet V2.0 Configuration Testing Protocol
(ECTP). ECTP is an Ethernet layer test procotol, specified in section 8 of
the second version of the Ethernet specification - "The Ethernet",
Version 2.0 (1982). It supports:

	o unicast testing - an ethernet layer "ping". This can include a
	  strict source route - a list of stations to visit during the test.

	o broadcast or multicast discovery of ECTP "loopback assistants".
	  The discovered stations can then be used for unicast testing,
       	  either as unicast test destinations, or as part of the strict
	  source route.

This program needs to be able to open PF_PACKET sockets for raw packet reading
and writing. This requires either root priviledges, or more specifically and
more safely, the CAP_NET_RAW capability.

The CAP_NET_RAW capability can be assigned to the executable using the
following command:

	setcap cap_net_raw=ep <ectpping binary>

As a note of CAUTION, ectpping has been developed in somewhat of a hurry,
such that functionality took precendence over security. In other words,
it might be full of buffer overflow opportunities and other nasty things. It
probably won't be, but you never know; I certainly don't. If you discover
any, be assured they were completely unintentional. Patches to fix problems
(security or otherwise) are most welcome.

Consequently, it is strongly recommended that, should you choose to install
it system wide, restrict its use to trusted users, and assign CAP_NET_RAW
via 'setcap' rather than making the binary setuid root.

To build it:

	make

which should result in an 'ectpping' binary in the current directory.
